Monolith Disadvantages

Overload IDE
Scaling is very difficult (for scaling need to scala entire system ,ci job,regression hard,debugging hard)

Microservices Advantage
Scaling easy
Debugging easy


Microservices Disadvantage
Latency can increase if we don't decompose the monolithic systems properly.
Monitoring is difficult S1 -> S2 -> S3 (s3 changed response from a to a')
Transaction Management is difficult.

Decomposition
Decomposition by business functionality.
Decomposition by subdomain.
