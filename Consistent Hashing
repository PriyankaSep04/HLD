Hashing


Use of Consistent Hashing

Only 1/n % of rebalancing is requited then consistent hashing

How it works?
Virtual Ring

Set server randomly. * hash(server)%n
Get the value where to keep server

key11 hash(key1)%n

it reduces key rebalances required when a new server gets added or existing one gets deleted.

How it solved problem
